# ZEROLIB

![build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/01010111/zerolib.png)

Zerolib is a library of extensions, utilities, and other helpful classes for making games quickly in haxeflixel!

**notice: this library is in an alpha state, and may introduce breaking changes with updates**

## Installing
With Haxe and Flixel installed, use this command to install:
```
haxelib install zerolib
``` 
Then, add the following to your game's `Project.xml`:
```
<haxelib name="zerolib" />
```
Then you'll be set!

## Usage
This library is split into three distinct sections, Extensions, Flixel Utilities, and Other Utilities.

Check the WIKI for specific usage instructions!

### Extensions
Extensions are a neat language feature of Haxe. They can add functionality to preexisting classes. There are several extensions in this library that add some functionality to Flixel classes, as well as generic Haxe Types!

Learn more about using Extensions [here](https://github.com/01010111/zerolib/wiki/Extensions)!

### Flixel Utilities
This section includes a bunch of classes to help you out in your flixel adventures!

### Other Utilities
This is the smallest section and just contains some classes that I use often in my own projects.
